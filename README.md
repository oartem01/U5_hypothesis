Contribution to the field of RNA biology
Almost every human gene transcript undergoes alternative splicing, made possible by the imperfect conservation of splice sites. The challenge for the spliceosome is to combine flexibility with routine precision. The recognition of splice sites is a multistage process which involves base pairing with small nuclear (sn)RNAs, the components of the spliceosome. The intron interactions with U6 and U2 snRNAs are much better studied than the exon interactions with U5 snRNA. We propose a new model for U5 binding to exons by comparison of splicing with retrotransposition, as essentially the human spliceosome is a ribozyme that shares a primordial mechanism of splicing catalysis with bacterial mobile introns. Statistical analysis of human splice sites and the covariance of the interactions made by exons and introns lends support to this model. We find that U5 Watson-Crick pairs with the exons show a clear pattern of compensation for substitutions of the conserved nucleotides in human introns, indicating a collective mechanism whereby U5, U6 and U2 recognise their variable binding sites. We suggest that snRNAs in the pre-catalytic spliceosome together ensure fidelity before the committed ribozyme core is configured. We discuss potential applications of these findings for developing snRNA-therapeutics and future gene repair by reverse splicing.
